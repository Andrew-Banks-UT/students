Hello, my name is Owen Queen, and I'm a junior in computer science and math. I am interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science, concentrating on machine learnig and data science with applications to biomedical informatics. I like AI, data science, and mathematical modeling. In my free time, I like to rock climb and hike.
