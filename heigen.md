I am Henry Eigen and I am a student at the EECS department. I've been programming for fun ever since I taught myself how to code in the 9th grade. The more I learn about how different software engineering as a job is from SWE for fun, the more interested I am in dropping out and becoming a carpenter or similar career which doesn't have version conflicts and Jira boards.
